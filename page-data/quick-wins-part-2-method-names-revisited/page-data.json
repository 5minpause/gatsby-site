Hence no robot told me about my error. I believe it is a good example of the benefit of automatic linting. This error would have been found. If you read the code and were put off by this naming scheme, you even experienced why conventions and rules are necessary: Because coding by the rules helps developers to focus on the semantics of the code, not the syntax.\"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"The second problem\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Do you remember that I wrote about JavaScript loops and gave the classic \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"for\"), \" loop example?

Perhaps you did not like this idea and my example? Let me take a step back for a second.\\nWhen naming variables and method names, you have to make sure they \\\"speak.\\\" The names should indicate their meaning and make it easier for another developer to understand the semantics of your code. Yet, when you are fully aware of the problem domain you code deals with, it can happen that you try to be \", mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"too specific\"), \". If you are, you tend to use long, verbose names for variables and methods. An example could be this:\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"img\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"src\": \"https://holgerfrohloff.de/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/example1.png\",\n    \"alt\": null\n  }), \"\\nA common value for the allowed length of method names is 30 chars.

Verifying and fixing meta tags surely does not need to be done inside this class. If you want to follow the Single Responsibility Principle, you should make sure that the Article class does not have a reason to change, if you decide to change something about verifying and fixing meta tags. Rather the Article class might change when you decide that an article should have a mandatory sub-headline.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Back to the \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"iterator\"), \".
