Apply my knowledge and make things better.\\nLooking from the outside in, it seems easy to have small wins that improve the project.

Then you could test against the API and it could evolve and things still would work. As long as you fulfill the contract. The content is only provided via this API. The users of your engine won't ever have a way to access content directly.\\nSecond, I would use a document-based database.
