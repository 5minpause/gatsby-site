I write my newsletters on my Mac or iPad (or sometimes iPhone). I want my writing to appear as an email, sent to you. But it also should appear on my website, without me having to copy and paste markdown files, commit them and deploy it. Then it should ideally be distributed to LinkedIn, Xing (that's a German LinkedIn \\uD83D\\uDE09) and perhaps Twitter. All automatically.

Projects where I can tinker and explore at my one pace. Where I do not have to keep track of the hours spent and where I can just have fun.
