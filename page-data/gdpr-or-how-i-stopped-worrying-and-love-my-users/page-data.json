The GDPR came into force on May 25th and now things will change? Depends on the people! Everywhere you could hear developers screaming and cursing about this regulation and the amounts of work they had to do to appropriately deal with it. While I do understand them (I had to do the same work on my business and websites and on my clients\\u2019s) my standpoint is a little different. I am an optimistic person who always sees the light and tries to find ways to optimize or at least improve situations. And the GDPR represents on of those. You see, you have to deal with these things required by the regulation anyway. You can\\u2019t escape them. So let\\u2019s take the opportunity and do the work necessary to fulfill the requirements, and then some.\\nThe regulation offers enough single points that you can take and make your systems more secure.
