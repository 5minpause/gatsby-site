While, sadly, this state is still unchanged, there's another story there that relates to software development:\\nThe new door bell needed some power. The old one did not need this much power (230 volts), so there were no appropriate power cables laying around. That's why we cut a different cable that lay in the vicinity but usually powers the automatic gate for the car. The plan was to have something like a t-shaped connection between the cables. So the gate would still have power, but a new cable would lead to the door bell and everything would be fine\\u2122. So I cut the power cable to the gate.
