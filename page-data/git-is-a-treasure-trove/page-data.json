What happens when these people leave the company like Alice? Are you aware what your stack is made up of across all your teams? It's called the technology sprawl.

Analyzing can make you aware of parts of the code that too many people work on. If too many people work on the same code you have increased communication efforts. Bugs can creep into those parts since it is probable that some of the developers contributing do not have enough knowledge of the module. They might make wrong assumptions.

Before, we looked at how many people contributed to the same modules and files. Now we will talk about what they commited. When using Git you decide what makes up a commit.
