These are mostly texts like this, or documentation for software I've written or discussions on Pull Requests, stuff like that.

It just so happens to be easier to use for development with its placement of characters necessary for development. But I also need the umlauts when writing German words. So I switch a lot of times between the layouts. It's fairly easy on Mac OS, I just press the shortcut Ctrl-Option-Space (you can set this in the System Settings). But since I switch between different apps a lot during the day it always incurs a small overhead for me to see if I have the right language selected and change it if necessary.
