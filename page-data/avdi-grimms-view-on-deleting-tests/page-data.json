Any help they provide with preventing regressions is gravy.\\nI treat unit tests as disposable. Once they have served their purpose as design aids, I will only keep them around so long as they aren't getting in the way.\\nThese four premises are strongly interconnected. Take away #1 (test first), and tests are no longer a design aid and none of the other points are valid. Take away #2 (isolation) and we get into integration test territory where there's a much higher possibility of tests having regression-prevention value. Take away #3 (design focus) and the other points lose their justification. Take away #4 (disposability) and I spend all my time updating tests broken code changes.\"), mdx(\"p\", {\n    parentName: \"blockquote\"\n  }, \"This makes  it easy for me to find myself at cross purposes with others in discussions about unit testing, because often they come into the conversation not sharing my premises.

I almost think that what I really want out of unit tests is the ability to fiddle with live objects in a REPL until they do what I want, and then save that REPL session directly to a test for convenience in flagging API changes.\"), mdx(\"p\", {\n    parentName: \"blockquote\"\n  }, \"That conversation also spawned the idea of immutable unit tests: unit tests that can only be deleted, never updated.
