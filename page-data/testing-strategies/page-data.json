Small companies often don't have the time or money to test their apps properly. Sometimes the knowledge on how to design and code an application isn't evenly distributed in the team. Peer review might not prevent mistakes or bad decisions (again: time and money). The state of an application gets worse, the longer it is maintained.\\nWhen I come to a company with little or no tests and they ask what they should do, I often recommend to create a small risk assessment for the features of their app. Once you know the critical paths through an app and the risks for each you can start to test these features outside-in.\\nCritical paths with high risk differ from case to case, but things like \\\"password forgotten\\\" and \\\"shopping cart payment\\\" are candidates that rank high all the time.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Ideally you would have unit tests for your classes.

Write acceptance tests for these parts. Keep it to one or two tests of the \\\"happy path\\\" where everything works. Once these are covered you can decide whether to start a refactoring or add more tests. More tests could mean \\\"sad paths\\\" as well, or unit tests for some of the more modular components.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"This will help you gain certainty that you don't break your most important features when you start the bigger refactoring.
