Hi friend.

You might remember that I told you about my "type", the INTJ (Architect). Reader Gary wrote in to share his thoughts about that (quoted with permission):

Thanks Gary!
I am reading a book about development practices right now. And this brought my thoughts back to this topic again: What types would make an ideal team of developers + manager?

So if you could design your optimal team, what types would you take (bonus points for the "why")?

If enough answers come in, I'll summarise.

Yours,
