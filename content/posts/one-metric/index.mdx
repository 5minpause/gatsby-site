I spent the day at a new client's office. They hired my to do a complete code quality and security audit for their website and shop system. They are rebuilding and relaunching it. The app is built using Ruby on Rails.

The client asked for my expert opinion about the general code quality as well as specific hotspots like PayPal integration.
I will create multiple pages of in-depth analysis and recommendations on how to improve the project.

Starting this project today consumed all of my attention, thus you get this letter now. It's evening here for me in Berlin and I couldn't be happier with how the day went. There were points in my past where co-workers snared at my thoroughness and me being (over)precise. It turns out these are very good attributes to have when it comes to an audit like this.

Yours,
Holger
