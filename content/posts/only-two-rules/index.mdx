There are only two hard rules when doing code review with your coworkers:

1. Keep it professional. Don't. Get. Personal.
2. Don't take it personal.

Remember that you are talking about letters and symbols in files. Nothing more and nothing less.
You are doing this to improve the results, the software.

You are not your code!
