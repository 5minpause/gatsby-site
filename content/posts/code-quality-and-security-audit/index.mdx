From the feedback I got for my questions and letters regarding the quality of software projects, I can tell you one metric software developers look for.
<!--more-->
**Test Coverage**

Well, that was no real surprise, was it?

Let me tell you another metric:

**Documentation**

Can you guess who cares for that? Users of your software. They donâ€™t care for tests. But they want to know how to use the thing they paid for. (Even if itâ€™s OSS they do pay for it: With their attention and time.)

Project managers on the other hand might care about both metrics. Most of the time, Iâ€™d wager, they care even more about planning and risk management of the project. As I am married to a wonderful wife who works as a great project manager, Iâ€™ll verify this statement tonight ðŸ˜†. (Iâ€™ll report back)

The person authorizing the budget might care the most about the costs. And yes, the price (in ðŸ’µðŸ’¶ðŸ’·ðŸ’´) people have to pay for your results is a quality metric of itself.

My point is this: While there are many different aspects for the quality of a project, which one you should put a priority on depends on your target audience.

Yours,
Holger
