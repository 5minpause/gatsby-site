Over the weekend I had (kind of) a conversation with a good friend. The topic revolved around doing **the work** on software projects, and how that is sometimes harder to do in a right way. Because of external factors, or because of company policy. In essence, this creates frustration. Probably nothing new there for you.

It may be that I describe things in a too positive way for you, here. Perhaps you read my letters and think to yourself, that things don't work like that in the real world. Maybe you don't have enough freedom in your projects to be able to care for quality in a way that would satisfy you? If that's the case, I would like to learn about that. Tell me about your frustrations and the things that hinder you from doing your work. Don't be afraid to share. I'll keep everything confidential.

Still, I will continue with my mission to increase software quality and to tell about that world in which software projects are finished on time and budget, with high-quality code and best practices. I do know from experience that this world exists. And even if we cannot get there every day, do not lose track of the goal. If there are even single days, where you can come close to that, these are good days. And striving for raising software quality in your projects will make them better eventually. Constant dripping wears away the stoneâ€¦

Yours,
Holger
