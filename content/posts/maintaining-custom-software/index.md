Jeena [writes about the challenge to maintain a custom blog software](https://jeena.net/notes/1301). I feel the challenge. I started rewriting this very site in Rails, to be able to include [Webmentions](https://github.com/converspace/webmention/blob/master/README.md) and support other IndieWeb features. But sadly, I didn't find enough time
recently to work on the project.  
So cheers to Jeena and hopefully, he'll be able to upgrade to Rails 7.
Once I've finished some more client projects, maybe I'll be able to take the time to work on this site more.
