Today I want to share a small utility with you. I am a heavy user of Git, for years now. I am confident to use it on the command line, yet I still come back to using the application Tower (for Mac) regularly. Something about a visual representation other than the Terminal attracts me.

Today I tried out [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit). I believe I found it in the Hacker Newsletter or something similar. It just might be something like the best of both worlds.
Just wanted to really quickly share that with you.

Yours,
Holger

PS: Yes it really is a nerdy tool. And it looks cool and is a nice encouragement 
to actually learn Go and send some pull requests.
