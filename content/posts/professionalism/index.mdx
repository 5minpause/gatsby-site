This morning I was visiting the hospital with my pregnant wife. She’s in the 39th week and over the course of the weekend we had some concerns regarding the health of the baby. So we went to the hospital to have everything checked. They made a CTG for the heart and vital signs of the baby.

This feeling when you’re worried about something mostly out of your control… feeling helpless. And then the doctors and midwifes help you and take care of you… This is a very strong feeling and emotion. The professionalism that they show in calming you down and making sure you’re alright.

If you ask me, that’s what I aim for with my clients. They don’t have to worry about our project, because I am there and taking care of everything. That’s my mantra.

What’s yours?
