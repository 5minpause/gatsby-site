Changes!

I joined my last client, Edeka, in April 2020. Since then I am not freelancing anymore. My old Wordpress site ran on quite expensive hosting. Which I could justify as a business expense. But since those are gone now, I have to switch to something cheaper.

This site now runs as a GitHub pages site, powered by Gatsby. Which I love quite a lot.
And now I am free to experiment with this site more, again.
