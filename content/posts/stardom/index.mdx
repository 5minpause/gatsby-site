Do we have software development stars? I was wondering. We have people like David Heinemeier-Hanson who created Rails. We have Martin Fowler and Uncle Bob, among several others. Are these stars?  <!--more-->
If so, why is that? Because constantly produce high-quality software (or products)? Or is it because they are very verbal? Some advanced the craft of software development and still do, so that might be a reason. But they just did their jobs, right?

I am really asking hereâ€¦ Do you have stars?

Yours,
Holger
