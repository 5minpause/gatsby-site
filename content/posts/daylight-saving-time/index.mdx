Did you hear about the [European Union polling its citizen about whether DST is really necessary](https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/5/17536400/european-union-polling-citizens-daylight-saving-time-necessary)?

Because I  thought it's funny I sent this issue an hour later than usual.

I was wondering what happens with our apps and services, if DST suddenly isn't "necessary" anymore. The offsets for saved timestamps become invalid?<!--more-->
What about already recorded time like a `created_at` or `updated_at` timestamp? Do we keep the old offset and have to also keep around **when** it was recorded? Because up until a certain date these offsets were still valid, and after the date these aren't valid/possible anymore?

DST exists in the US as well, I believe. I _guess_ they could abandon it as well, once Europe does it. This would be an **interesting time** (pardon the pun).

Timezones and handling time is always something that has to be handled with care, but having big changes like abandoning DST **really** makes it interesting.

I am interested to hear what you think about the implications of abandoning DST.

Yours,
Holger
