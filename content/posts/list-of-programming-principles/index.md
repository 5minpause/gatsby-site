# List of programming principles

This is a nice list of principles you could (or should?) follow in your programming.

[https://github.com/5minpause/programming-principles][1]

_Disclaimer: I **forked** the repository from the original source. I want to preserve it for you since I don't know what will happen to the original._

While things like YAGNI and KISS are rather well known, there are other ideas that are put quite well.

Examples:

- Encapsulate What Changes
- Orthogonality
- Inversion of Control

To be clear: This list is nothing new. I do like the way they put it together, the idea that it's growing and the further resources they link to.

Have a look!
