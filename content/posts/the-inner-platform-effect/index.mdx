> “The Inner Platform Effect is an anti-pattern that occurs when a software system is designed to be so customizable that it ends up being a poor imitation of the platform it was designed with.”

Matthew has started a new series on anti-patterns in software development. <!--more-->He starts with the Inner platform effect. This is an anti-pattern I did now know before but was able to recognize once I read his explanation and examples. 

What about you? Can you find examples for it? Tell me about them!

You can read his article [here](https://exceptionnotfound.net/the-inner-platform-effect-the-daily-software-anti-pattern/).

Yours,
Holger
