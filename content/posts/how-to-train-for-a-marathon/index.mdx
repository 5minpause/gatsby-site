If you want to run a marathon, you have to train for it. Very few people can do that without deliberate training. You have to run for many kilometers consistently and do speed and interval training in between. If you let your training slip, it means your performance on race day will be worse.

If you want to deliver high-quality software on release day, you need to measure and work on the quality of your software every day. If you let it slip and don't take care of issues, they will pile up, Technical Debt will increase, and your quality will suffer.

So, how's your training going?

Yours,
